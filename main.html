	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete, usually measured in terms of the number of operations performed. An efficient algorithm has a low time complexity, allowing it to solve problems quickly</p>
<p>Space complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses. <b>Space Complexity</b> is often measured in terms of the maximum amount of memory used, expressed as O(n), where n is the size of the input</p>
